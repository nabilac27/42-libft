### **libft** - Standard Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of the **42 Libft** project, 
a custom C library that replicates essential standard C library functions. 

It includes fundamental utilities for memory management, string manipulation, and more, 
acting as a core building block for many **42** projects.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Memory Management**: Functions such as `malloc`, `free`, and `calloc` for dynamic memory handling.
- **String Manipulation**: Key string functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, etc.
- **Utility Functions**: Various helper functions for a wide range of operations.

This project is designed to help strengthen understanding of C programming, 
focusing on low-level memory manipulation, pointer management, and efficient coding practices.

### **libft_v2** - Enhanced Version

This repository contains my **enhanced version of Libft**, 
which builds on the original **42 Libft** by adding extra utilities and functionalities 
tailored to the more complex requirements of **42 projects**.

#### **Key Additions**:
- **`ft_printf`**: A custom implementation of the `printf` function for formatted output.
- **`get_next_line`**: A function to read lines from a file descriptor efficiently.

This version of **Libft** serves as a more comprehensive and optimized library, 
providing reusable and high-performance code for various **42** projects.
