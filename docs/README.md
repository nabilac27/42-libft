libft
This repository contains my implementation of the 42 Libft project, a custom C library that replicates essential standard C library functions. It includes basic functions for memory management, string manipulation, and other utilities, serving as a fundamental building block for many 42 projects.

libft_v2 - Enhanced Version
This repository contains my enhanced version of Libft,
a custom implementation of essential C library functions, 
expanded with additional utilities tailored to the requirements of 42 projects. 

It also includes:
ft_printf: A custom implementation of the printf function for formatted output.
get_next_line: A function to read lines from a file descriptor efficiently.

This project serves as a foundational library for various 42 projects, 
providing reusable and optimized code.
